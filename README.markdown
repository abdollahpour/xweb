# XWeb
XWeb is simple modular library to create JavaEE base web applications. As you know, Java is the one the best programing language that exist nowadays, with a lot of documentation and over 100 solution for each feature that you want!!

Java is also very popular and powerful in Web applications, but there's some problem. There's some powerful and massive projects like [Spring Framework ](projects.spring.io/spring-framework), but the problem is, most of these projects are so big and heavy for our purpose and you should load ton of libraries to make simple feature! But with XWeb, you have many cool features, clean API and you can run it on lightweight application server like [Tomcat ](tomcat.apache.org) and [Jetty ](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty) in less that 1 MB!

Let's look at the main feature of XWeb framework:

* Fully modular: You can Use, create and extends modules so simple! Each module also simplify many thing for you.
* Data tools: You can validate and generate Java objects from GET and POST request in single line of code!
* [Authentication module: ](https://github.com/abdollahpour/xweb/wiki/AuthenticationModule) Ultimate solution for authentication, support create exact pattern for authentications, remember login (with cookie), Captcha support, single file or fully database support.

You are able to authenticate, restrict, validate, compress and do many other cool things just with simple XML file (xweb.xml). You can use XWeb for simple project without even one line of Java code! But for more feature like connect it to database, add advance user functionality and more, you need to simply extends some modules, or you write your own module.
